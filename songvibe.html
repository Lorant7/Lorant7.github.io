            <h1>Song Vibe Inference Project</h1>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Music has been around for thousands of years, but only in today's world we have it on demand. We get to
                enjoy the songs we know and love with a few simple clicks. But we are human, we can get bored of
                listening
                to the same thing over and over again. The solution of music providers was to create an AI that
                recommends
                songs based on the metadata (i.e. the genre, artist, release date, etc.) and what other people are
                listening
                to. This was great, we have an easy solution to exploring new songs, genres, and artists. Still, I find
                myself skipping most of the songs recommended by the AI, simply because it doesn't fit into what I am
                listening to. It doesn't go with the "vibe" that I am looking for at the moment. That is where this
                project
                comes in.
            </p>
            <p>The Song Vibe Recommendation System is a project aimed at analyzing the "vibe" of songs to create
                personalized music recommendations. Unlike traditional recommendation algorithms that rely on user
                behavior,
                this system focuses on extracting and analyzing the audio features of songs themselves.
            </p>
            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>Imagine an intelligent system that understands the “feel” of a song—its energy, rhythm, and mood—and uses
                that understanding to recommend music you’ll love. Instead of just relying on user ratings or genres,
                this
                project focuses on analyzing the actual sound of the music itself. That what I aim to do with this
                project:
                to develop a scalable machine learning model that captures the essence of a song's vibe by leveraging
                advanced audio analysis and vector space embedding.
            </p>
            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
            <p>To make this possible, I’m using advanced tools and techniques from the world of artificial intelligence
                (AI)
                and machine learning (ML). Think of it as creating a digital fingerprint for every song, capturing
                details
                like beats, melody, and harmonics. These fingerprints help the system figure out how similar one song is
                to
                another.</p>
            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Feature Extraction: Using the librosa library to analyze audio features such as beats, onset
                    strength,
                    and harmonic-percussive components.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Vector Database: Storing song features in a high-dimensional vector space using Milvus for efficient
                    similarity search and scalability.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Scalability: Leveraging Azure cloud services to handle large datasets and computationally intensive
                    tasks.
                </li>
            </ul>
